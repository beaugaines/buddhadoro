# A most basic pomodoro timer written in Python.

This script is no beauty and is cribbed from others code.
But it gets the job done.  And that job is is to
provide a timer for the [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com)
that is easy to use and delimits your work periods not by annoyingly
locking your screen with no warning and not by having a dancing
gnome pop up and ask you to cease pounding your keyboard for a
few minutes, but with a tranquil and soothing *GONG* of a Tibetan
bowl.  The whole point of taking a break is to not look at your screen,
and with an audible cue you can do that.  And do whatever you want for
your break:  mediatate, do some exercises, walk around the office, close
your eyes and recite poetry, eat a pop tart.  The possibilities are
endless.

## Usage:

python buddhadoro.py 'WORK_TIME BREAK_TIME'

e.g!

python buddhadoro.py 25 3
(25 minute work sessions, 3 minute break)

After three work sessions you have a ten minute break.  If you haven't
eaten your pop tart by then, this is your chance.
